\title{Summarize SWAT output data}
\usage{
summarize_swat_output(swat_output, water_year = FALSE, water_year_start = 9)
}
\arguments{
\item{swat_output}{A data frame containing SWAT output data, typically
read using the \link{output_rch}, \link{output_sub}, or \link{output_hru}
functions.}

\item{water_year}{Logical. If `TRUE`, adjusts data to hydrological years,
starting from the specified month.}

\item{water_year_start}{Integer. The month to start the hydrological year
(default is 9 for September).}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
  \item `daily`: Original daily data (if the input is daily, otherwise
    `NULL`).
  \item `monthly`: Aggregated monthly data or original input if already
    monthly.
  \item `annual`: Aggregated annual data.
  \item `mean_annual`: Mean annual values for each HRU, subbasin, or reach.
  \item `mean_annual_cycle`: Mean monthly climatology for each HRU,
    subbasin, or reach.
  \item `mean_annual_LULC`: Mean annual values aggregated by land use/land
    cover (only for HRUs).
  \item `mean_annual_basin`: Area-weighted mean annual values across the
    entire basin (only for subbasins and HRUs).
  \item `mean_annual_cycle_basin`: Area-weighted mean monthly climatology
    across the entire basin (only for subbasins and HRU outputs).
  \item `basin_area`: Total area of the basin (only for subbasin and HRU
    outputs).
}
}
\description{
Processes SWAT model output data from reaches, subbasins, or HRUs and
aggregates them at different temporal and spatial scales.

- If the input data are daily, they are aggregated to monthly and then
  to annual scale.\cr
- If the input data are monthly, they are aggregated directly to annual
  scale.

Additionally, the function computes climatological summaries:\cr
- Mean annual cycle and mean annual values for each simulated variable
  at the HRU, subbasin, or reach level.\cr
- Mean annual values by land use/land cover (LULC) for HRU outputs.\cr
- Basin-wide climatological summaries, including mean annual cycle and
  mean annual values, which are area-weighted averages across the entire
  watershed (only for subbasin and HRU outputs).
