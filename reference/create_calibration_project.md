# Create a SWAT calibration project

Creates a new SWAT calibration project by copying all required input
files from an existing `TxtInOut` folder into a new project directory. A
`Backup` subfolder is also created and populated with the same inputs so
original files can be safely restored during iterative calibration or
sensitivity analyses.

## Usage

``` r
create_calibration_project(
  swat_TxtInOut,
  destination_dir = NULL,
  project_name,
  set_working_dir = TRUE
)
```

## Arguments

- swat_TxtInOut:

  character. Path to the existing SWAT `TxtInOut` folder.

- destination_dir:

  character. Directory where the new project will be created. If `NULL`,
  defaults to the current working directory.

- project_name:

  character. Name for the new calibration project.

- set_working_dir:

  logical. If `TRUE` (default), sets the working directory to the new
  project's `TxtInOut` folder.

## Value

Invisibly returns `NULL`. Prints a message with the path to the newly
created `TxtInOut` folder.

## Details

Output files typically generated by SWAT (e.g., `output.rch`,
`output.sub`, `output.hru`, etc.) are excluded from the copy to keep the
project clean and reproducible from inputs.

  on.exit(setwd(old_wd), add = TRUE)

# Write the example SWAT project into a temporary directory
tmpdir <- tempdir()
get_swat_example(tmpdir)
#> SWAT TxtInOut files written to: /tmp/RtmpqhcGSX/TxtInOut

# Create a calibration project (adds Backup) and set it as working directory
create_calibration_project(
  swat_TxtInOut   = file.path(tmpdir, "TxtInOut"),
  destination_dir = tmpdir,
  project_name    = "calib_project",
  set_working_dir = TRUE
)
#> The calibration project has been successfully created in /tmp/RtmpqhcGSX/calib_project/TxtInOut
