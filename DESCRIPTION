Title: Multiobjective Calibration and Workflow Tools for SWAT
Description: Provides tools for the multi-objective 
    calibration and workflow automation for the Soil and Water Assessment Tool
    (SWAT). Implements the elitist Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II 
    (NSGA-II) with parallel execution for efficient optimization of large 
    parameter sets. Enables flexible calibration configurations, including 
    multi-site, multi-variable, multi-metric, and multi-period strategies, 
    enhancing the robustness of model calibration. Additional tools support 
    preparation of climate forcing data, execution of SWAT simulations, 
    performance evaluation using more than 20 hydrological metrics, and 
    post-processing for spatiotemporal analysis of SWAT outputs. 
    Compatible with both standard SWAT and its tropical variant (SWAT-T).
